 * as their API, allowing other components to implement them.
 *
 * Normally these interfaces only have static functions.
 *
 * Implementers can optionally declare a public $weight integer value, which
 * allows the modification of the order in which a certain hook's implementers
 * is called. If not specified, a value of 0 is assumed.
